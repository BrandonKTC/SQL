The COALESCE function in SQL is used to return the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions.
It's a versatile tool for handling NULL values and ensuring that your queries return
meaningful results even when some values may be missing.

Basic Syntax:

The COALESCE function takes a list of expressions as its arguments and returns the first non-NULL value.
If all values are NULL, it returns the NULL value.

e.g :

SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name,
COALESCE(email, 'No email provided'),
COALESCE(phone_number, 'No phone number provided')
FROM employees;
