The CASE statement in SQL is a powerful tool for performing conditional logic and transforming data.
It's similar to an IF/THEN statement in other programming languages,
allowing you to evaluate expressions and return different results based on specific conditions.

Basic Format:

The basic format of the CASE statement consists of a WHEN condition, a THEN result,
and an optional ELSE statement. It's typically nested within another SQL statement, such as SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

e.g :

SELECT customer_id,
CASE
	WHEN (customer_id <= 100) THEN 'Premium'
	WHEN (customer_id BETWEEN 100 AND 200) THEN 'Plus'
	ELSE 'Normal'
END AS customer_class
FROM customer


Mutiple Case Format: 

e.g:

SELECT                                                             SELECT
SUM(CASE                                                           SUM( CASE rating
	WHEN (rating = 'R') THEN 1                                          WHEN 'R' THEN 1
END) AS r,                                                              END) AS r,
SUM(CASE                                                           SUM( CASE rating
	WHEN (rating = 'PG') THEN 1                                         WHEN 'PG' THEN 1
	ELSE 0                                                              END) AS pg
END) AS pg,                                                        SUM( CASE rating
SUM(CASE                                                                WHEN 'PG-13' THEN 1
	WHEN (rating = 'PG-13') THEN 1                                      END) AS pg13
	ELSE 0                                                         FROM film
END) AS pg13
FROM film
