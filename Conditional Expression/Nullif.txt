The NULLIF function in SQL is used to compare two expressions and return NULL if they are equal, otherwise,
it returns the first expression. It's particularly useful for handling NULL values and ensuring consistent data manipulation.

SELECT order_id, order_status,
CASE 
WHEN NULLIF(order_status, 'pending') IS NULL THEN 'Order status not set' # check if order_status = 'pending' elif = null then = 'Order status not set
ELSE 'Order status is pending'                                           # else 
END AS order_status_validation
FROM orders;
