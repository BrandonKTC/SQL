SELECT customer_id, staff_id, SUM(amount) from payment
GROUP BY customer_id, staff_id
HAVING staff_id = 2 AND SUM(amount) > 100;

The HAVING statement is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY clause.
It works similarly to the WHERE clause, but it is used after the GROUP BY clause.
The HAVING clause can be used to filter groups of rows, while the WHERE clause can only be used to filter individual rows.
