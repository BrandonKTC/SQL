SELECT * FROM TableB
FULL OUTER JOIN TableA
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match

The FULL OUTER JOIN statement in SQL combines rows from two or more tables,
including rows that do not have matching values in the other tables.
It is similar to a LEFT OUTER JOIN or a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, but it includes all rows from both tables,
regardless of whether they have matching values in the other table.

This example is the Opposite of a INNER JOIN :

SELECT * FROM TableB
FULL OUTER JOIN TableA
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match
WHERE TableA.id IS null OR TableB.id IS null

it only grab rows which are unique to TableA and TableB
