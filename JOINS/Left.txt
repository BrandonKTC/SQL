SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match

The LEFT JOIN statement in SQL is used to combine data from two or more tables.
It is similar to the INNER JOIN statement, but it includes all of the rows from the left table,
even if there are no corresponding rows in the right table.

This SQL statement only select row that are present on TableA but not on TableB

SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match
WHERE TableB.id IS null
