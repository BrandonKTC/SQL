SELECT * FROM TableA
INNER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.col_match = TableB.col_match

The INNER JOIN statement in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a specified relationship between them.
The INNER JOIN clause ensures that only rows that have matching values in the specified columns are returned.
