Inline subqueries are enclosed in parentheses and appear within the WHERE clause or the SELECT clause of the main query. For example,
the following query selects all employees who have a manager who has a salary greater than $100,000

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IN (
SELECT employee_id
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 100000
);
