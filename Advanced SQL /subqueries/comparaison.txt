Subqueries are a way to embed one SQL query inside another SQL query.
This can be used to filter data or perform calculations based on the results of another query.


Subqueries can be used with all of the comparison operators. For example,
the following query selects all products that are more expensive than the average price of all products

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
