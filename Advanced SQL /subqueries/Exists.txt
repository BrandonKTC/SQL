Subqueries and the EXISTS operator are both powerful tools for querying data in SQL.
The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns any rows, and FALSE otherwise.

The EXISTS operator can be used in a variety of ways, including:

Checking for existence: You can use the EXISTS operator to check whether a particular condition exists in a table.
For example, you could use the EXISTS operator to check whether a customer has any orders.

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = customers.id
);
