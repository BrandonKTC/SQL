A view in SQL is a virtual table that is not stored physically in the database but is instead defined by a SQL statement.
It acts as a window into the data from one or more tables, allowing you to retrieve, manipulate,
and analyze data in a more convenient and efficient manner.

Creating a View:

To create a view, you use the CREATE VIEW statement, specifying the view name,
the SELECT statement that defines the view's contents, and any optional conditions or modifications.

CREATE VIEW customer_info AS 
SELECT first_name, last_name, address FROM customer
INNER JOIN address 
ON customer.address_id = address.address_id


Then you can grab the created view by using it's view name :

SELECT * FROM customer_info
