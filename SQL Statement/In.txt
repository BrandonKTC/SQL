SELECT col_name FROM table_name
WHERE col_name IN (val1, val2, val3)

The IN operator is a versatile tool for filtering data based on lists of values.
It simplifies data retrieval and manipulation tasks, making it an essential part of SQL queries.

eg:

SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 10 AND id IN (
  SELECT product_id FROM orders
  WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2023-12-01'
);
