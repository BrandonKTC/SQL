SELECT col_name FROM table_name

The LIKE and ILIKE operators in SQL are used to search for patterns in strings.
They are both similar in their basic functionality, but they differ in their handling of case sensitivity.

LIKE Operator :
The LIKE operator is case-sensitive, meaning that it will only match strings that exactly match the specified pattern.

ILIKE Operator :
The ILIKE operator is case-insensitive, meaning that it will match strings that match the specified pattern regardless of case.
