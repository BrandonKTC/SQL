SELECT col_name FROM table_name
LIMIT num;

The LIMIT clause in SQL is used to restrict the number of rows returned from a SELECT query.
It can be used to either specify a maximum number of rows to return, or to skip a certain number of rows before returning any rows.

SELECT col_name FROM table_name
LIMIT num OFFSET offset_value;

The OFFSET clause can be used to specify the number of rows to skip before returning any rows.
This can be useful when combined with the LIMIT clause to implement pagination.
